/// OperationPool is an abstraction to coalesce deterministic operations.
///
/// When you have an _expensive_ operation like a network request or resizing a
/// large image, it is common to resort to caching. But caching only avoids
/// extra operations once the first one has finished.
///
/// OperationPool takes care of coalescing multiple transformations for the same
/// resource, executing only once, and notifying of completion to all the
/// requesters.
///
/// Each operation transforms a `Key` into a `Value`. This could be a URL to a
/// data object, an image to a smaller image, or anything else. In any case, the
/// same `Key` should always produce the same `Value`.
///
/// Defining custom operation pools
/// -------------------------------
///
/// To define your own custom operations you can subclass OperationPool. All of
/// the defined methods are `final` so you are not supposed to override
/// anything.
///
/// Instead, define your own convenience initializer and call `init(_:)` with
/// your custom `start` function.
///
/// An alternative is to use a factory function instead:
///
///     func RequestPool(session: NSURLSession) -> OperationPool<NSURLRequest, NSData, NSError> {
///         return OperationPool { request, completion in
///             let task = session.dataTaskWithRequest(request) {
///                 data, response, error in
///     
///                 let result = Result(
///                     value: data,
///                     error: error,
///                     fallbackError: NetworkError.noDataAndNoError.nserror
///                 )
///                 completion(result)
///             }
///             task.resume()
///         }
///     }
/// 
/// Subclassing operation pools is only meant as a sort of typealias plus a
/// constuctor. If you need something more complicated, the recommendation is to
/// create a different type that just holds an instance of an operation pool.
///
/// Threading considerations
/// ------------------------
///
/// OperationPool is thread safe and can be called from any thread. Optionally,
/// it can be initialized with a queue in which the completion blocks will be
/// called. By default it uses a global low priority concurrent queue.
///
/// When an operation finishes, all the completion blocks are queued
/// asynchronously at the same time.
///
/// Note that there's a delay between the time the `start` function calls its
/// `completion` function and the completion blocks are called. If you want to
/// add some caching of results, the recommended way is to handle storing the
/// cached values from the `start` function to avoid duplicate operations.
///
/// When a new `request` causes an operation to start, your `start` function
/// will be called synchronously. It is your responsibility to ensure that your
/// `start` function doesn't block the caller thread.
///

    /// already in progress. When the result is available, this function needs
